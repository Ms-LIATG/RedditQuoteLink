# Reddit Quote & Link
I originally made this for personal use, because I often quote comments from one thread and post them in the other, and I like to link them so that others can see where the comment I'm referring to lies in the thread. This tool takes a comment link, and spits out the full comment, quoted and linked, into your clipboard

I am bad at this description thing
